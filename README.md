# Low Back Motion Classification
This is a repository to explore machine learning methods for classifiying motion signals acquired from a series of motions including lateral bending, axial roatation, forward bending, forward bending while rotating to the right and left. The details of how each motion is performed is described in this [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9934370/).

## Normal Signals
Normal signals are acquiered from healthy individuals which were asked to perfom motions without any further instruction.

## Anomalous Signals
Normal signals are acquiered from healthy individuals which were asked to perfom motions pretending that they are experiencing back pain.
